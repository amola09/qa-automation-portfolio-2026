/*
Q. what is 'this'?
   - js reserved keyword or variable
   - 'this' always containing dynamic value which is object
   - 'this' is a object (Dynamic object)
   - which object ?
    - containing dynamic value/object according to its scope:
      1. In script & functions : this ==> window 
      2. In method  : this ==> owner object
          Depends on function type and its nested structure
      3. In constructor : this ==> new instance.

# this scope depends on function type and its nested structure :
  # Type of function:
   1. Normal function : (function declaration & expression)
    - 'this' value is dynamic
    - Depends on how/where the function is called

   2. Arrow function :
    - 'this' value is static
    - Depends on the where the function is declared/written
    - Enclosing lexical context/scope

**Regular functions : have their own `this` context which can change depending 
on how they are called. 
In strict mode, if called without a context, `this` is `undefined`.

**Arrow functions : do not have their own `this` context. 
They inherit `this` from the surrounding lexical context 
where the arrow function is defined, which avoids 
the issue of `this` being `undefined` in strict mode.
