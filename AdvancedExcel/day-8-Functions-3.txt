Function Name	        Syntax	                                              Description
COUNT ( )	      COUNT (value1, [value2],...) 	     The COUNT function counts the number of cells that contain numbers.
		
COUNTA ( )	        COUNTA(value1, [value2], ...) 	 The COUNTA function counts the number of cells that are not empty in a range. The COUNTA function counts cells containing any type of information, including error values and empty text (""). The COUNTA function does not count empty cells. 
		
COUNTIF ( )	        COUNTIF(range, criteria) 	     The COUNTIF function counts the number of cells within a range that meet a single criterion that you specify. 
		
COUNTIFS ( )	    COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2,criteria2]…)	Applies criteria to cells across multiple ranges and counts the number of times all criteria are met. 
Sum                 = SUM(A1:A10)                                                 Adds numbers together.
Sumif               = SUMIF(A1:A10,"Math",B1:B10)                                 Adds numbers only if a condition is met.
sumifs              = SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criteria1,               Add numbers that meet multiple conditions.
                    [criteria_range2, criteria2], …)
Averageif           = AVERAGEIF(A1:A10,"Math",B1:B10)                             Finds the average based on ONE condition.
Averageifs          = AVERAGEIFS(C1:C10,A1:A10,"Math",B1:B10,">=80")              Finds the average based on MULTIPLE conditions.
