Pivot Table: used to summarize, analyze, explore, and present large sets of data.
It allows users to quickly rearrange data to see different summaries and comparisons — like totals, averages, counts — without changing the original dataset.

Basic Rules:
1. Well-structured data: Your data should be in a tabular format, with no blank columns or rows and clear headers.
2. Each column should contain the same type of data (e.g. dates, numbers, text).
3. The data should ideally be in a flat format, not nested or hierarchical.

Limitations:
1. Source Data Size: Very large datasets can make pivot tables slow to refresh or crash Excel.
2. Real-Time Updates: Pivot tables do not auto-refresh

Steps to Add Pivot Table:
1. Select data
2. Click on "Insert" Tab ==> Click on Pivot table dropdown ==> Select "From Table/Range"
2. Step 2 shortcut ==> Alt+N+V+T
3. Confirm Table Range ==> Select Pivot table Location as per your choice ==> Click on "OK"
